# Button

This code started from the nrfx-blink-sdk example from Apple.  
Please look into the LED folder for more information and introduction on how to build.

This folder contains a Swift Button class that abstracts away all the C calls to Zephyr and presents a natural interface for interfacing with a button (really any digital input on a GPIO pin).  
This is a basic use case, with limitations, and will be further developed in another project.  

Check out the [Creating a Swift type for button input on nRF52 - Part 1](https://www.ericbariaux.com/posts/button_embedded_swift_nrf52/) blog post to follow along as we build this sample code.
