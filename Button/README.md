# Button

This code started from the nrfx-blink-sdk example from Apple.  
Please look into the LED folder for more information and introduction on how to build.

We start by implementing everything in C, calling a single function from Swift.  
This ensures we have a working foundation, without having to tackle any of the issues Embedded Swift might throw at us.
